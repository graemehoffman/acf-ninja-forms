Adds an Advanced Custom Fields field to select one or many Ninja Forms.

== Description ==

This is an Advanced Custom Field custom field to select one or many [Ninja Forms](http://www.ninjaforms.com/).

= Using the field =

The field lets you pick one or many fields.

The data returned is either a Form object or an array of Form objects.

If you have selected a single form and you want to display the form on the page, you can use:

`
<?php
    $form = get_field('your_form_field');
    if ( function_exists( 'ninja_forms_display_form' ) ) {
        ninja_forms_display_form( $form[ 'id' ] );
    }
?>
`

Ninja Forms 3.X.X
`
<?php
$form = get_field( 'your_form_field' );
if ( class_exists( 'Ninja_Forms' ) ) {
    Ninja_Forms()->display( $form[ 'id' ] );
}
?>
`

Ninja Forms 2.9.X
`
<?php
    $form = get_field( 'your_form_field' );
    if ( function_exists( 'ninja_forms_display_form' ) ) {
        ninja_forms_display_form( $form[ 'id' ] );
    }
?>
`

You can find out more about the Ninja Forms methods to embed a form on a page in their [documentation](http://docs.ninjaforms.com/)

If you are using the field to select multiple forms, you will have to iterate over the array.  You can then use the form object as you like:

`
<?php
    $forms = get_field('your_forms');
    foreach( $forms as $form ){
        echo $form[ 'id' ];
    }
?>
`
