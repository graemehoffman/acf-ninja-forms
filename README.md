# ACF Ninja Forms Field

This is an Advanced Custom Field custom field to select one or many [Ninja Forms](http://www.ninjaforms.com/).

## Compatibility

* ACF version 5
* Ninja Forms version 2.9.X and up

## Installation

This add-on can be treated as both a WP plugin or a theme include.

*Plugin*
1. Copy the 'acf-ninja-forms' folder into your plugins folder
2. Activate the Advanced Custom Fields: Ninja Forms Field plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

*Include*
1. Copy the 'acf-ninja-forms' folder into your theme folder (can use sub folders). You can place the folder anywhere inside the 'wp-content' directory
2. Edit your functions.php file and add the code below (Make sure the path is correct to include the acf-ninja-forms.php file)

```
function my_register_fields() {
    include_once( 'acf-ninja-forms.php' );
}
add_action( 'acf/register_fields', 'my_register_fields' );
```

## Using the field

The field lets you pick one or many fields.

The data returned is either a Form object or an array of Form objects.

If you have selected a single form and you want to display the form on the page, you can use:

*Ninja Forms 3.X.X*
```
<?php
$form = get_field( 'your_form_field' );
if ( class_exists( 'Ninja_Forms' ) ) {
    Ninja_Forms()->display( $form[ 'id' ] );
}
?>
```

*Ninja Forms 2.9.X*
```
<?php
    $form = get_field( 'your_form_field' );
    if ( function_exists( 'ninja_forms_display_form' ) ) {
        ninja_forms_display_form( $form[ 'id' ] );
    }
?>
```

You can find out more about the Ninja Forms methods to embed a form on a page in their [documentation](http://developer.ninjaforms.com/)

If you are using the field to select multiple forms, you will have to iterate over the array.  You can then use the form object as you like:

```
<?php
    $forms = get_field('your_forms');
    foreach( $forms as $form ){
        echo $form[ 'id' ];
    }
?>
```
